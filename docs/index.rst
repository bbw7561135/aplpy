`APLpy <http://aplpy.github.io>`_ (the Astronomical Plotting Library in Python -
pronounced *apple pie*) is a Python package module aimed at producing
publication-quality plots of astronomical imaging data, and has been around
since 2009. Since APLpy 2.0, APLpy no longer does the plotting directly and
instead provides wrappers around Astropy's `WCSAxes
<http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/visualization/wcsaxes/index.html>`_ package
to draw the coordinate axes and grids, which in turn uses `Matplotlib
<http://matplotlib.org>`_ to do the rendering. For questions about
backward-compatibility, see the `Backward-compatibility notes`_

Should you use APLpy?
=====================

The `WCSAxes`_ package in Astropy can be used without APLpy to produce plots of
astronomical images. It provides a programmatic interface that is conceptually
very close to Matplotlib, and can be used to make plots that are more complex
than what APLpy has historically been able to do. If you want to be able to
control the appearance of your plots in detail, including for example adding
overlay coordinate systems, or if you simply want a programmatic interface that
is consistent with Matplotlib, then we recommend you use `WCSAxes`_ directly. If
you have a FITS file and just want to make it into a plot in a couple of lines,
then APLpy is the package for you.

Backward-compatibility notes
============================

APLpy continues to include a :class:`aplpy.FITSFigure` class that provides a
simpler interface and deals with the reading of FITS files and constructing WCS
objects. This class uses `WCSAxes`_ behind the scenes, but provides easy methods
for overlaying shapes, beams, adding colorbars, and overplotting regions. The
interface of this class is intended to be backward-compatible with existing
scripts that used APLpy 1.0 and earlier.

However, in some cases, the :class:`aplpy.FITSFigure` may not be
backward-compatible, in particular if you have made adjustments to figures in
the past using private attributes (e.g. ``fig._ax1``). For these cases, we have
provided a frozen copy of the APLpy 1.x FITSFigure class in the ``aplpy.legacy``
package - you can use this using::

    from aplpy.legacy import FITSFigure

Note that no new features will be added to this class. Critical bugs may be
fixed if reported, but otherwise for any non-critical issues, we recommend
migrating to the new :class:`aplpy.FITSFigure` class or `WCSAxes`_ directly.
